# ForensicsWithPython
This was my senior project, hopefuly someone can use it more

Current issues with the program:

-the data from the main output list box doesn't alwaysget filtered by the regex properly

-couldn't get deleted files to separate out properly

   can't view their meta data due to issues I've had with separating on a colon (:) litteral
  
-Could do with a better layout

-Maybe a better color scheme?


I'd like someone to be able to take it and be patient and learn how to execute investigative commands on a suspect image.
